Destroy aliens and bosses and protect your planet from the alien invasion.
Avoid being abducted or destroyed for as long as possible!

Controls:
D-PAD: Move
A: Fire a single missile forward
B: Fire two missiles to the left and right

Tips:
~ Score points by destroying aliens and bosses.
~ Aliens that make it all the way across the screen subtract from your score.
~ Only 3 missiles can be on screen at a time, aim carefully!
~ Remaining missiles are shown at the bottom right of the screen.
~ During a boss encounter normal aliens do not add or subtract from your score, focus on the boss!
~ Boss health appears in the top left of the screen.
~ While being abducted, the ship can't move but can still fire missiles forward at a delayed rate (a bar appears above the missile count).  Keep mashing and stay alive!
~ Normal aliens gain a new movement type after each boss is defeated.
~ The high score can be cleared in the logo screen.
~ Sound effects can be toggled on or off in the logo screen.
