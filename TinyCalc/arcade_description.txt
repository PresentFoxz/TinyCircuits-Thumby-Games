Tiny Calc

The littlest calculator.
Highlight numbers and symbols with the D-pad, press the highlighted number
or symbol with the A-button, and clear with the B-button.
Additionally supports '**' for powers, e.g: 4**2=16.

Created with Blockly as a test of the Blockly integration into
the Thumby Code Editor. See the Blockly file here:
