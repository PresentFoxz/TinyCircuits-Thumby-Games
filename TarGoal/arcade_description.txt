TarGoal (Targets, Goals)

WARNING: Read all of this before using the app.
And keep in mind that is not a game, just a kinda usefull app.


"Ever wondered where to make a to-do list and keep it with you wherever you go?
Are you afraid of the idea that it's hard to make such an app with save option?
Don't worry! We have what you need, except for turning the device off before quiting the app... This way will don't save the changes you made..."


Remember the buttons map:

____|UP|____       (A)
LEFT   RIGHT   (B)
---|DOWN|---

---OR---

____|^|____      (A)
<--    -->   (B)
----|v|----

Controls(be careful for combination, respect the order of pressing!!):

After the thumbnail disappears:
You are in:
=LIST OF TARGETS/TASKS MODE (just a simple list)=
- ^ - navigate up through the list of targets/tasks
- v - navigate down through the list of targets/tasks
- <-- - Change "backwards" through the list of icons for the respective task you are on
- --> - Change "forwards" through the list of icons for the respective task you are on

-> How to "tick" a target?(more exactly, will be a line that cut the text) 
- (B) + ^ - mark or unmark the target

-> How to unmark all targets?
- (A) + ^ - unmark all targets

-> How to make a new task?
- (B) + <-- - Enter "NEW TARGET MODE"

=NEW TARGET MODE=
You will see that the screen had changed.
Well you are in an mini text typer with a mini keyboard to navigate and change the keymaps on.
How can you use it?:
You will see a white-small-square indicator. It indicates on which letter/character you are on the minikeyboard.
- ^ , v , <-- , --> - Use D-pad buttons to navigate one the small keyboard
- (A) - cycle through the group of keymaps
- (B) - type that letter/character!
- (A) + <-- - you will exit from that mode, saving what you wrote
(You can delete a character by navigating with the indicator on the "<--" , left arrow, which is a Backspace :] ; There's no ENTER/"new line" or full-delete options. )

Keep in mind that when you are making a new target, it will add under/next to the one you were on! ;)

You will go back, but there are some modes left to explain:

-> How to switch between two targets?
- (B) + --> - a switch icon will appear (I know it will be hard to press with two fingers, so I recommend to press those two close buttons with one finger ;] )
You will see that an icon of two arrows, meaning...
=SWITCH TARGETS MODE=
You will see also the number of the target you have selected to switch. Now you can go to any other target you already have and press again:
- (B) + --> - Now your switching method is done! After that , the icon of the 2 arrows will disappear!
(Sadly, you can cancel it by "switching" to the same target...)

And the last MODE:
- (B) + v - a trash bin icon with a question mark will appear
You will be locked on that target you were and you have to answer if you want it deleted for sure?:
=TRASH BIN MODE=
- <-- - YES (Yes, it will be gone)
- --> - NO (You will keep it, no worries)

"Last MODE? How do I exit the app?! BUT HOW DO I SAVE??"
"Wow, wow, calm down. Here we are, at the last thing..."
-> How do I save?
-> How do I quit?
- (A) + <-- - Save the list of targets/tasks and quit with no more problem!

!!AGAIN, DON'T POWER OFF THE DEVICE IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE LIST!!

EXTENSION: It also works in combination with my other app I made, the "Keyboard".

"Thanks for reading!! ^w^ <3
Have a nice day full of tasks!! :))"

"Oh man... A lot to do, right? Well let's tick them all as soon as possible, trying our best!! ^u^"
