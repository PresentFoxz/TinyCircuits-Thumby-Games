A small 3D demo, using a display controller hack for flicker-free 4 shade greyscale (16 shades with dithering).
Features spinning and/or bouncing objects, an Outrun-style road, stars, mountains that might be pyramids, and randomly generated music.
The full source code is over 100KiB, so this version has been tidied up and stripped of comments for the arcade... full source can be found at github.com/doogle/Journey3Dg

Please note that this will not run in the emulator.
