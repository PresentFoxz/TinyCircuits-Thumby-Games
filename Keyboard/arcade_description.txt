Keyboard (Nemo.the.fishboy style)

WARNING: Read all of this before using the app.
And keep in mind that is not a game, just a kinda usefull app.


"- How I am able to have a keyboard just from 6 buttons?!
- No problem!! We always find at least a solution for each one!!"


Remember the buttons map:

____|UP|____       (A)
LEFT   RIGHT   (B)
---|DOWN|---

---OR---

____|^|____      (A)
<--    -->   (B)
----|v|----

Controls(be careful for combination, respect the order of pressing!!):

After the thumbnail disappears:
= <,>,v,^ - Navigate through the buttons
= B - send the selected character to the other Thumby
= A - change the keymap
= A + ^ - pop up/ hide a small icon with the selected letter zoomed in
= A + v - access the instructions manual
= A + < - exit the app

IT IS AN EXTENSION: It only works in combination with other applications. The application alone won't do anything anymore...
COMPATIBLE WITH: [Targoal];
