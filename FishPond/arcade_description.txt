Choose one of four very tiny fishing spots to catch many different fish! 

Hold A to power up your cast. Different fish require different cast powers to catch. 

Wait for a bite, and when you see !!!, press A to catch the fish!

If you can catch every fish in all four locations, you might unlock a secret...

In the settings menu, you can view your fishing records, replay the tutorial, turn sounds on and off, and clear your save data. 

Happy fishing!
