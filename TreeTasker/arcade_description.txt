TreeTasker 
by Nemo.the.fishboy

!! A better app than an other one I made, "TarGoal", which has just a simple list of tasks or goals where you can cross them or not, and WITH MANY 2 BUTTONS COMBINATIONS :( That's frustrating to remember all the button combinations and what they do... So I came with a great idea of making a little complex view of tasks and a complex way of organizing them.

WARNING: Read all of this before using the app.
And keep in mind that is not a game, just a kinda usefull app.


"- Oh man... I want to use at least a device where I can write my tasks easily and check, tick, cross,whatever on them...
- No problem!! We have TreeTasker, a way of writing your task and organizing them even as "subtasks" I call them! You will find out!"


Remember the buttons map:

____|UP|____       (A)
LEFT   RIGHT   (B)
---|DOWN|---

---OR---

____|^|____      (A)
<--    -->   (B)
----|v|----

Controls(be careful for combination, respect the order of pressing!!):

After the thumbnail disappears:
= <,>,v,^ - are for navigating through the tasks or tabs,
/or/ for moving when it comes to move something
/or/ for going through the keymap

= B - is more often for approving
/or/ for changing the task's status
/or/ for selecting a character when writing
/or/ for as a "YES" button

= A - is more often for canceling
/or/ opening actions() list (like, adding a new task, or a new subtask, or for renaming, etc)
/or/ for exiting
/or/ for changing the keymap
/or/ for  as a "NO" button

--> The first tab is for saving your current day, or to clear the boxes from the list by moving to the next day (already arrived in your present time)
--> And the other 2 are for Going through the "Daily List" or "List of tasks"(which can be completed whenever you like)

"Thanks for reading!! ^w^ <3
Have a nice day planning out things!! :))"

"Now we can view the tasks more simply and completing them easily, can't we? ^u^"
