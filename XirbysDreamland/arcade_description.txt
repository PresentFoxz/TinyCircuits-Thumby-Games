Xirby's Dreamland
Vol.1 Coco Clouds
_______________________________________________

Very Simple, Short Game with fun graphics~!

Music included with multiple Original tracks

All Music was hand composed by myself, which sounds pretty great in the emulator!
However, my Thumby has a broken speaker, so sadly I could not test music on real device.

All Art was also drawn by myself on Pixaki an ipad application for pixel art and animations. The art is loosely based on famous characters, but was shrunk and drawn
to fit a tiny 72x40 1 bit screen.

Game was tested and played in Emulator and on Real Device

Game Improvements

This code could be improved by storing Graphics and Music in separate.py files and 
calling to the Main.py for better organization. However, when play testing in emulator , this caused a lot of call and import problems (especially if the emulation check boxes were not in order). 

I decided for simplicity of a new learner reading my code to store it all in one place, but it does make it very tedious to read. 

Game could probably be better organized than using if statements to switch screen to screen and to trigger events. 

Game play could be improved by adding more enemy spawn variations, more graphics, and more levels. I limited the spawn amounts for visibility reasons, as the screen size is very small and it is hard to see multiple moving objects at once on a moving background.

Best parts of the game that can be copied to other games:

The Class objects creating the Character, Enemy, Item. 
The use of Collision Detection
The Health Meter and Heart System
The Sparkle effects and moving backgrounds 
The use of changing music per scene
The Fun Intro Sequence Animation with Xintendo and Xame Freak
The secret Code detection function
